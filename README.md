# Tic-Tac-Toe-UI
Tic-Tac-Toe - This game is very popular and even fun to build as a Python project.
The game: It is a two-player game and consists of a nine-square grid. Each player chooses their move and with O or X and marks their square one at each chance. The player who succeeds in making their marks all in one line whether diagonally, horizontally, or vertically wins. The challenge for the other player is to block the game for their opponent and also to make their chain. Try to create a basic game what can be played once at least and will display which player is the winner.
